Abstract

The xylophone recording project consists of two basic modules in order to record xylophone notes - the Human Computer Interface (HCI) and the Communication module.
The HCI is being used to visualize the xylophone, the controllers, the song system and places all of these in a nice virtual environment.
In the Communication module there are several submodules which could be used to transport the played xylophone notes to roboy.
There's the MidiBridge for local Midi output, which could be forwarded to another computer on the network via a tool called Jack2.
Another option is the usage of ROSBrige to send Midi data via ROS.
The last communication module is the MidiRecording which saves the Midi output to a Midi file.
