Current State
================

Xylophone
-----------

The Xylophone is modeled like in the real world.
Only thing still missing due to no testing is the integration of a variable velocity detection which forwarded to the communciation modules.

Environment and Controllers
-----------------------------

We build a quite good looking environment for the user and the xylophone. The environment is a STARWARS theme. The xylophone sits on the back of a X-Wing Fighter, and surrounded by thousands of stars. Several TIE Fighters would fly by, and the death star is also in sight. It is a very fancy environment for the user to play xylophone.

There are currently three controllers, or, sticks for the user to use, which are a normal stick, a stick with a Roboy head, and a light saber. The user can switch between them and use each one of them to play the xylophone. When playing xylophone, different sticks play different sounds.
