Xylophone Hero
===================

Motivation and Introduction
--------------------------------

When the user is playing the xylophone in virtual reality, he may sometimes feel at a loss and don't know what to play. Therefore, we decided to add a song system, which can tell the user which note should he/she play and when to play. Furthermore, we considered that some gaming features can be added to the system, such as a score system and more fancy visual effects.

Inspired by the famous video game serious Guitar Hero, we name our song system Xylophone Hero.
